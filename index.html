        </h3>

            group winning 5 games Inter, Sherrif and Shaktar while experiencing
            a shock defeat to Sherrif at the Bernabeu
          </li>
          <li>
            Real-Madrid came behind from a 1-0 defeat to PSG to clinch an
            aggregrate score of 3-2 after a beautiful master class from Benzema
          </li>
          <li>
            Real-Madrid had their revenge against helsea football club providing
            a late come back to win the game in extra time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Against all odds while being at the backfoot for most of the
            encounter, Madrid once again showed the magic and resilience of the
            Bernabeu with unsung hero Rodrygo scoring late in three minutes to
            move the game to extar time. Benzema once again came through with
            the winner as Madrid held on.
          </li>
          <li>

            Vinicius clinching the win to grant Madrid their 14th Champions
            league win. Salah would have to get his win some other time.
          </li>
        </ul>
